        <h5>Acknowledgement of risks:</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          You hereby acknowledges that you are fully aware and, understand, the risks related to the use of the
          Shibanova.io Services, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A significant risk of losses of your cryptocurrencies, inherent with trading, holding and transacting;
          </li>
          <li>
            A risk of partial or total loss of your cryptocurrencies due to the exploitation by third parties of the
            Shibanova.io smart contracts, coding errors, UI, domain and DNS weaknesses;
          </li>
          <li>
            The price and liquidity of your cryptocurrencies may be subject to large fluctuations. The value of
            cryptocurrencies is derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency
            for cryptocurrencies, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of your
            Cryptocurrencies should the market for your Cryptocurrencies disappear;
          </li>
          <li>
            Transactions made with Cryptocurrencies on the Binance Smart Chain are irreversible, and, accordingly,
            losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions are not recoverable;
          </li>
          <li>
            All Crytocurrencies transactions made on the Shibanova.io website are deemed to be made when recorded on a
            Binance Smart Chain public ledger. The public nature of said transactions may lead to an increased risk of
            fraud or cyber- attack.
          </li>
        </ul>
